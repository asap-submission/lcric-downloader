# Lcric Downloader


Just execute the downloader script for downloading all the match videos.

```
python lcric_download.py
```

This will create a `videos` directory. The annotations can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tTQZmypR8dbai9ZrM5IiTSMVNCzX61Y2?usp=share_link).


### Collective Drive for both videos and annotations

Alternatively, the match videos along with the annotations can also be downloaded from the drive link [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1P189zYXDMCQgJWJQY7ZsEFQ6QlMvQ-af?usp=sharing).
