# Lcric Downloader


Just execute the downloader script for downloading all the match videos.

```
python lcric_download.py
```

This will create a `videos` directory. The annotations can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tTQZmypR8dbai9ZrM5IiTSMVNCzX61Y2?usp=share_link).


### Collective Drive for both videos and annotations
